# 🌾 Crop Type Classification with GeoFMs

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline to classify crop types (cocoa, rubber, oil palm) using pixel-level time-series data from Sentinel-2 and embeddings generated with pretrained geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs).

[Challenge hosted on Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/amini-geofm-decoding-the-field-challenge)

---

## 🚀 Goal

Use pretrained GeoFM models (e.g., **Amini Earth FM**) to extract embeddings from multitemporal Sentinel-2 data and train a classifier to predict crop type on an unlabeled test set.

Final output: a `submission.csv` with probabilities for each crop per `unique_id`.
